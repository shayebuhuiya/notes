1. 行转列：

   宽表转长表：例如原本一行是一个同学所有科目的成绩，长表的一行就是一个同学一科的成绩。

2. 使用union 和 union all

   union 不会包含重复行，union all包含重复行

3. 实例一：

   #### [1795. 每个产品在不同商店的价格](https://leetcode.cn/problems/rearrange-products-table/)

   ```sql
   # Write your MySQL query statement below

   from Products
   where store1 is not null
   union
   select product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 as price
   from Products
   where store2 is not null
   union
   select product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 as price
   from Products
   where store3 is not null
   ```

4. 实例二

   #### [1783. 大满贯数量](https://leetcode.cn/problems/grand-slam-titles/)

           from Championships 
       ) as table_temp
       group by player_id
   ) as table_p 
   on table_p.player_id = p.player_id
   ```
