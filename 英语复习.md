## Unit 1 Identifying Key Issues

## ten rules

Ten Simple Rules for Good Presentation:

* Talk to the audience
* Less is more
* Only talk when you have something to say
* Make the take-home message persistent
* Be logical
* Practice and time your presentation
* Use visuals sparingly but effectively
* Review the audio and video
* Provide appropriate acknowledgments

Explain for the ten rules:

1. "Talk to the audience" means trying to know who your audience are and delivering what they want to hear
2. Provide main messages rather than all the details, for the audience only remember a fraction of what you have to say.
3. If you're not well-prepared, don't risk giving a talk of boring and meaningless material, because the audience's time is precious.
4. If your audience can remember three points you were trying to get across a week later, you have done a good job.
5. Make your presentation like a logical story with a clear beginning, body and ending (false) . Try to tell a story to make your presentation understandable to the audience by direction their attention.
6. Making a presentation is, in a sense making the entertainment, so the speaker should try what he can to amuse the audience (false) . It's true that you want to essentially make the entertainment when you're giving a presentation, but that doesn't mean you must do something that's not within your character.
7. The more you practice, the less you will be likely to go off on tangents.
8. Never have more than one slide per minute. Avoid reading the visuals unless you wish to emphasize something explicitly.
9. Review the audio and video files of your own presentation before you give a presentation (false) . Review the audio and video of your own presentation to see what can be improved. There's nothing more telling than seeing yourself on film.
10. Express your gratitude to those who have made contributions.
